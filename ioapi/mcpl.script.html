    MCPL():  Run-Script Control of the Module
</H1>

    This module is principally controlled by environment variables and
    by ASCII tables found in files under standard 
    <A HREF = "/products/ioapi/H.LOGICALS.html">logical names</A>,
    according to EDSS/Models-3 conventions.  A <STRONG>template</STRONG> 
    for scripts that set these environment variables <A HREF="env_vars.txt">is 
    available <STRONG>here</STRONG></A>.  The script must deal with
    <STRONG>three important points</STRONG>:  
    <UL>
        <LI>  Description of the MCPL output grids relative to the 
              grids in the MM5 nested-domain system.  For a particular 
              output grid and the MM5 nest domain from which it is extracted,
              <A HREF = "nest.gif">this diagram</A> (also available
              <A HREF = "nest.gif">in PostScript</A>) shows how the 
              output grids are described in terms of specification 
              parameters <CODE>EM_I0</CODE> and <CODE>EM_J0</CODE>
              for the grid offsets, and <CODE>EM_NCOLS</CODE>,
              <CODE>EM_NROWS</CODE>, and <CODE>EM_NTHIK</CODE> for
              output grid dimensioning.<P>
              NOTE that 
              <UL>
                   <LI> Air quality modelers tend to think in terms of
                        cell-volume values rather than point-values.
                        The diagram is drawn from that point of view.
                   <LI> For variables which require decoupling of dot
                        point values (e.g., wind components, or wind
                        speed), the output grid  must be strictly
                        smaller than the MM5 grid--it must not contain
                        the first or last horizontal column nor row of
                        the MM5 grid.  MCPL will decide on a domain-by-domain
                        basis whether this condition is satisfied,
                   <LI> If you want to output air quality model grid-boundary
                        data structures, the output grid  must be strictly
                        smaller than the MM5 grid, also.
              </UL><P>
        <LI>  Specification of output file characteristics, particularly
              which files are produced, which subsets of the set of all
              possible variables for each file are actually output, and
              what are the starting date, time, and timestep for each file.
        <LI>  Specification of the output files themselves (i.e., what
              directory path and what actual file name to use, associated
              with a <A HREF = "#logicals">standard set of &quot;logical
              names&quot;</A> which are independent of the particular
              directory structure and run being executed), and whether
              the files are &quot;volatile&quot; (i.e., can be analyzed 
              while MM5 is still running or not).  This takes the form
              <STRONG><PRE>
      setenv &lt;standard logical name&gt; &lt;full file name&gt; [-V]
              </PRE></STRONG>
              where the optional <CODE>&quot;-V&quot;</CODE> indicates
              that the file is volatile.  <EM><STRONG>Note that if you
              want to analyze the output while MM5 is still running,
              <A HREF = "mcpl.script.html">your script</A> must declare
              the output files to be volatile.</STRONG>
    </UL>
    Environment variables that control these file characteristics are
    in the form of comma-delimited lists, with one value per output 
    grid, and are set (if you use <CODE>csh</CODE>) in the following 
    fashion (where we assume 4 output grids, FOO is an arbitrary
    integer-list-valued environment variable, and BAR is an arbitrary
    strign-list-valued environment variable):
    <PRE>
    setenv FOO '1,2,7,8'
    setenv BAR 'QUX,ZOP,GAK,MUD'
    </PRE>

    The <STRONG>list of these <A NAME = "env"> environment 
    variables</A></STRONG>, together with their meanings, is given below.

    <UL>  	 <!-- list of environment variables  -->

        <LI> <STRONG> MCPL_SDATE </STRONG> contains a comma-delimited
             list of the starting Julian dates for all output grids,
             formatted <VAR>YYYYDDD</VAR>, for MCPL() I/O&nbsp;API output 
             files (with default value taken from the current wall-clock 
             century and MM5's input variable MDATE (which is formatted
             YYMMDDHH);  if only one date entry is specified, it is used 
             for all output grids.
             Note that MM5v2 suffers from the Year-2000 problem (or more
             generally, a century-problem):  
             it only stores the 2-digit <VAR>year mod 100</VAR> 
             internally).  MCPL attempts to fill in the century digits
             from the current wall clock.  <STRONG>With MM5V2, the default 
             behavior leads to errors when the simulation century and the 
             wall-clock century are not the same.</STRONG>
             <P>
        <LI> <STRONG> MCPL_STIME </STRONG> contains a comma-delimited
             list of the the starting times for all output grids, formatted
             <VAR>HHMMSS</VAR>, for MCPL() I/O&nbsp;API output files
             (with default value determined by MM5's MDATE, which has 
             an hours field only).  If only one time entry is specified, 
             it is used for all output grids.
             <P>
        <LI> <STRONG> MCPL_TSTEP </STRONG> contains a comma-delimited
             list of the time steps for all output grids, formatted
             <VAR>HHMMSS</VAR>, for MCPL() I/O&nbsp;API output files 
             (with default value determined by MM5's TAPFRQ).  If only 
             one time step entry is specified, it is used for all 
             output grids.
             <P>
        <LI> <STRONG> GRIDDESC </STRONG> logical name for the 
             <A HREF = "/products/ioapi/H.GRIDDESC.html">Grid Description 
             File</A>. (Its value is the path-name for this file).
             <P>
        <LI> <STRONG> CRDNAM </STRONG> contains the coordinate system name
             for the coordinate system used by the model, as found in the

        <LI> <STRONG> EM_OUTGRIDS </STRONG> contains a list of MM5 domains
             into which the output grids fit.  <BR>
             <STRONG>These need to
             be in increasing order, e.g..&quot;1,1,2,2,2,3,3&quot;
             to denote that the first two output windows are from MM5
             domain 1, three more are from MM5 domain 2, and the last
             two are from MM5 domain 3.  <P>
             <EM>All other list-style
             environment variables use the same subscripting as
             EM_OUTGRIDS.</EM></STRONG>
             There may be more than
             one output grid per MM5 domain.  <EM>If this environment
             variable is not present, MCPL() assumes one output grid
             per MM5 domain</EM>
             <P>
        <LI> <STRONG> OUTGNAMES </STRONG> contains a comma-delimited list
             of root grid-names, used to construct the corresponding grid 
             names in GRIDDESC.  Each root name <VAR>X</VAR> will generate
             two GRIDDESC records, for the grids <VAR>X_CRO</VAR> and
             <VAR>X_DOT</VAR>, respectively the cross-point and dot-point 
             output grids for that grid.  Note that these root names
             can be <STRONG>at most 12 characters</STRONG> because of the
             necessity for adding tails <CODE>_CRO</CODE> or <CODE>_DOT</CODE>
             for the respective cross-point and dot-point grid names in
             <CODE>GRIDDESC</CODE>.

             row-offsets for the output grids relative to the domain from 
             which they are taken.  Offset 0 means that the output grid
             has the same starting row as its MM5 domain.<BR>
             Entries in the list should be separated by commas, and
             the list should be quoted in the <VAR>setenv</VAR> statement

             Needed only if MCPL will create GRIDDESC.
             <P>
        <LI> <STRONG> EM_J0 </STRONG> contains a list of MM5-domain (J)
             column-offsets for the output grids relative to the domain

             grid has the same starting row as its MM5 domain.<BR>
             Needed only if MCPL will create GRIDDESC.  Must have the

             Pascals (so that the half-levels run 1000.0E2, 950.0E2, ...,
