        <DT> Add <STRONG>extra EPA CMAQ output variables</STRONG>,
             as required for the <A HREF =
             "http://www.epa.gov/asmdnerl/models3/CMAQ/index.html">CMAQ

             <P>
             COMPLETED.  Released.
             <P>

        <DT> Add <STRONG>CCM2 RTTEN</STRONG> temperature tendency due to
             radiation (requires <CODE>IFRAD&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</CODE>).
        <DD> COMPLETED.  Released.
             <P>

         <DT> Add <STRONG>Ohio State LSM</STRONG>
             (<CODE>ISOIL&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</CODE>)
             and <STRONG>Pleim-Xiu LSM/PBL</STRONG>

        <DD> For MM5V3 only, and turned on only if OSU or P-X is active.
             <P>
             COMPLETED.  Released.
             <P>

       <DT> Add observation height variables <STRONG>TA2</STRONG>,

             in <A HREF = "mcpl.files.html#mc2">MET_CRO_2D</A>.
        <DD> For MM5V3 only, and turned on only for MRF PBL:
             It turns out that these are very useful for comparing with
             observational meteorology, as well as for coupling with
             models normally driven by observations.  It is also best
             done within MM5 PBL schemes, where it can be done
             consistently with the rest of the physics. Implementing
             this, however, involves PBL-scheme modifications for the
             user who wishes to take advantage of it.
             <P>
             COMPLETED.  Released.  Contact <A HREF =
             "mailto:carlie.coats@baronams.com,john.mchenry@baronams.com">the
             authors</A> for information about modifications to
             <CODE>HIRPBL</CODE> and <CODE>GSPBL</CODE> that generate
             these variables within those PBL schemes.
             <P>

        <DT> Remove variable <STRONG>RLD</STRONG> from
             <A HREF = "mcpl.files.html#mc2">MET_CRO_2D</A>.
        <DD> It turns out that the situation for longwave radiation in 
             MM5 is more complex than originally thought, including the
             fact that the meaning of <STRONG>GLW</STRONG> depends upon
             the physics options chosen.  RLD is not what we thought it
             was, and it looks quite complex to decide just what it
             should be, and then to implement that.
             <P>
             COMPLETED (i.e., RLD deleted as an output variable).
             <P>

        <DT> <STRONG>SLPRES option</STRONG> in file
             <A HREF = "mcpl.files.html#mc2">MET_CRO_2D</A>.
        <DD> Benjamin-Miller (1990) algorithm for calculating sea level
             pressure option, activated by defining preprocessor symbol
             <STRONG><CODE>MCPL_BMP</CODE></STRONG>, which then uses new
             routine <STRONG><CODE>MM2BMP</CODE></STRONG> for the
             calculation.
             <P>
             Coding COMPLETED.  Undergoing test at this time.
             <P>
             <EM>NOTE as of January 2001:  Results from it do not
             look as good as we'd like, at least running over the
             Eastern US at 15KM resolution.  BM will be an option but
             not one that we recommend nor use as our default.
             </EM>
             <P>

        <DT> <STRONG>UX, VX</STRONG>
        <DD> Wind component variables UX, VX at cross points in files
             <A HREF = "mcpl.files.html#mc2">MET_CRO_2D</A> (layer-1
             extraction for that file) and

             using new routine <STRONG><CODE>MMXUSDV</CODE></STRONG>.
             <P>
             Coding COMPLETED.  Undergoing test at this time.
             <P>

        <DT> <STRONG>More Detailed KF output</STRONG>
        <DD> Since precipitation and updraft/downdraft behavior turn
             out to be exceedingly sensitive to the numerics used, the
             KF event files now export the KFPARA-internal versions of 
             layer thickness DZQ and pressure thickness DP0 for the 
             model layers at cloud inception.
             <P>
             Coding COMPLETED and VALIDATED.
             <P>

        <DT> <STRONG>Task-Parallel MCPL() </STRONG>
        <DD> For MM5V2.11 and later (which implement 
             <A HREF="http://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP parallelism</A>)
             make separate OpenMP tasks for each output file 
             in MCPL_OUT().  This will allow greater efficiency
             on moderately-parallel platforms.
             <P>
             Coding COMPLETED and VALIDATED.  On SGI's, requires
             obscure run-time flags that set the per-thread stack-size
             and memory limits or else it will seg-fault.
             <P>

        <DT> New Variables <STRONG>SLPRS, DZ1000_850, DZ1000_500,
             DZ850_700</STRONG> in file
             <A HREF = "mcpl.files.html#mc2">MET_CRO_2D</A>.
        <DD> Compute sea level pressure and thicknesses between the
             1000mB and 850mB, 1000mB and 500mB, and 850mB and 700mB
             pressure surfaces, and put them out as new variables in
             file <A HREF = "#mc2">MET_CRO_2D</A>.  
             <P>
             COMPLETED and VALIDATED.
             <P>

        <DT> New file <STRONG><A HREF = "#pc3">PRES_CRO_3D</A></STRONG>
        <DD> contains 3D decoupled cross-point variables, interpolated
             to the standard pressure surfaces.  Note that this file
             uses a pressure vertical coordinate instead of a sigma
             coordinate.
             <P>
             Output variables for this file are controlled by PC3_VARS
             <P>
             COMPLETED and VALIDATED.
             <P>

        <DT> New file <STRONG><A HREF = "#pd3">PRES_DOT_3D</A></STRONG>
        <DD> contains 3D decoupled dot-point variables,  interpolated
             to the standard pressure surfaces.  Note that this file
             uses a pressure vertical coordinate instead of a sigma
             coordinate; decoupling of the winds requires that the
             output window is a proper window of the MM5 domain (e.g., 
             there is no value for PSTAR available at MM5 dot-point (1,1) ). 
             <P>
             Output variables for this file are controlled by PD3_VARS.
             <P>
             COMPLETED and VALIDATED.
             <P>

        <DT> More general <STRONG> output-window structure </STRONG> 
        <DD> supporting multiple output windows per M5 domain.  This
             will make MM5 more useful to the environmental modeling
             community in general (for coupled models work) at the cost
             of some additional complexity for run script
             configuration.<BR> <STRONG>COMPLETED</STRONG> in version
             &quot;C&quot;  and later, of <CODE>MCPL</CODE>, controlled
             by environment  variable <CODE>EM_OUTGRIDS</CODE> which is
             a list of how many output grids there are per MM5 domain,
             so that <VAR>setenv EM_OUTGRIDS 1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3</VAR>
             says that  MM5 domain 1  has 1 output grid, MM5 domain 2 has
             3 output grids, and MM5 domain 3 has 6 output grids;
             <CODE>EM_I0</CODE> (etc.) will then be expected to be a
             list with 1+3+7=10 entries.
             <P>
             COMPLETED and VALIDATED.
             <P>

        <DT> Support for <STRONG> KF cloud event files </STRONG> 
        <DD> via new <CODE>ENTRY MCPL_KF</CODE> to be called from
             MM5 module <CODE>KFPARA</CODE>.<BR>
             <STRONG>COMPLETED</STRONG> in version &quot;KF&quot; 
             and later, of <CODE>MCPL</CODE>.  Requires MM5V2.11
             or later if MM5 is to be run in parallel (in order for
             &quot;critical sections&quot; protecting the (serial)
             I/O to the KF-files.
