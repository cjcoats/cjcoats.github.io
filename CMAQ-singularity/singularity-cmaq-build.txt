 singularity create -s 8192 cmaq.img
 singularity build --sandbox /work/cmaq.sif library://library/default/centos

 in a terminal:

 singularity shell -s /usr/bin/tcsh --writable  /work/cmaq.sif

     cd /opt and then download and build the following (moving the
     sources to the indicated directories):
         git clone https://github.com/cjcoats/ioapi-3.2.git ~~> /opt/ioapi-3.2
         git clone https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git        ~~> /opt/CMAQ_REPO/

         git clone https://github.com/USEPA/AMET.git        ~~> /opt/AMET_v14/

     download and install the following under directory /opt:

        VERDI   from https://www.cmascenter.org/verdi/
        ncview  from http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html
        panoply from https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/

        NCAR Graphics from http://ngwww.ucar.edu/
        findent from https://github.com/wvermin/findent and build...

    Make symbolic links to /opt/bin for the following executables created above:
        findent
        panoply
        pave
        verdi.sh

    Copy nedit-resource files from initial host machine to /opt/share/nedit

    Major script revisions
      * Partition scripts so that there is a container-resident portion
        that knows about container specifics (e.g., directory-paths,
        etc.) and that uses environment variables to control the run;
        and a  host-resident portion that sets up environment variables
        (etc.) for the run and invokes the container-resident script.
      * Rewrite the scripts to deal with the container specifics.
      * Fix the scripts so that error-status is correctly recognized and
        passed up the script-invocation sequence so that errors are
        treated properly.
      * Fix the scripts so that user-customized executables can be used
        (see Appendix 2 of the User Manual).
      * Fix the scripts so that trying to run executables under a debugger
        actually works.
